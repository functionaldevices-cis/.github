# Information Systems

Welcome to Information Systems department's GitHub org. IS manages all internal information systems, such as Syteline. We also have one public repo, [Simpler Inputs](https://github.com/functionaldevices-cis/simpler-inputs) which was developed internally, but is available for us by anyone.

Chat with [Andy Mercer]([https://pages.github.com/](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/chat/0/0?users=a.mercer@functionaldevices.com)) for help related to any repos within this org.
